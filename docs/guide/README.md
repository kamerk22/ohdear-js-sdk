The OhDear Node library provides convenient models and methods to access the OhDear API from applications written in server-side JavaScript. 

Before moving forword we suggest you to checkout [OhDear REST API](https://ohdear.app/docs/api/introduction) documentation. It'll help you get better understanding.

- Read the [getting started](../guide/getting-started.md) guide for the SDK. 

The SDK currently supports the following services:

| API Name          | Class Name                                                                   | Status |
